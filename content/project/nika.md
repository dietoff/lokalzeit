Virtual Preview
I used to find exhibition openings often tedious and I thought of them rather as a task that has to be fulfilled than a pleasure. Now I miss them. The Virtual Preview is a nostalgic work and a visualisation of what I would really enjoy doing right now, meeting colleagues, friends and some new people in a large group.
