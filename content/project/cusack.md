### Hinterhöfe, fences, communities

This soundwalk around the Moritzplatz area focusses on the huge variety of Hinterhöfe there and the multitude of sonic places they create and isolate from the busy streets outside. There are old courtyards entered through narrow arches, exotic gardens enclosed by apartments so new that people are still moving in and green, wooded spaces between high buildings planned to be shared at the time of the Berlin wall but now divided by gates and a maze of wire fences. The walk pays close attention to the acoustics of these places and the sounds of the communities for whom this is home – murmuring voices and rustling shopping bags; the U-Bahn roar that appears from different directions as it reverberates around the spaces; crows in the tree tops; footsteps in autumn leaves; distant motorbikes; excited sparrows; echoes of children at play.
